## Step-by-step process:
* First, the module teleports you very high up (to the point where no one can kill you, hopefully) and freezes you there
* Then, it automatically makes your character archivable/clonable (because it cannot be cloned without the property `Archivable` enabled)
* It then clones your character and teleports to where you first activated it at
* You are now invisible! (Possibly, you have Godmode)
* You can set the stored configs to where you can `Fly` or `NoClip`
* To revert back to normal, you just have to reset! (It for some reason also spoofs your respawn time to the normal character...)
